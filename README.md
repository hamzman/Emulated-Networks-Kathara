# Emulated-Networks-Kathara
This is a repo that contains an emulated lab of the different types of technologies and routing protocols used in Internet Networking.

Each folder contains a specific protocol, appropriately named.

All the labs are standalone thanks to Docker and requires having a Linux environment (WSL or a VM) to run, with Kathara installed.

# Emulated-Networks-Kathara
This is a project that contains emulated labs of the different types of technologies and routing protocols used in internet networking.

Each folder contains a specific protocol and implementation, appropriately named.

All the labs are standalone thanks to Docker and requires having a Linux environment (WSL or a VM) to run, with Kathara installed.
